Perfect — you want nginx to **restrict access to certain routes based on client IP**, while leaving the rest of your React app public. This is done using the `allow` / `deny` directives inside a `location` block.

---

### Example: Protect `/admin-login` route

Assume the React route is `/admin-login`:

```nginx
location = /admin-login {
    root /var/www/multi/frontend/react-app/dist;
    index index.html;
    try_files $uri /index.html;

    # Restrict access
    allow 203.0.113.25;    # your company IP
    allow 198.51.100.42;   # another allowed IP
    deny all;               # block everyone else
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `location = /admin-login` → exact match for `/admin-login`.
* `allow` → whitelist specific IPs.
* `deny all` → block everyone else.
* `try_files $uri /index.html` → ensures React route still serves the SPA properly.

### If you have subroutes under `/admin-login/*`

```nginx
location ^~ /admin-login/ {
    root /var/www/multi/frontend/react-app/dist;
    index index.html;
    try_files $uri /index.html;

    # IP restriction
    allow 203.0.113.25;
    deny all;
}
```

`^~` ensures nginx matches all paths under `/admin-login/` and doesn’t pass them to the generic `/` React handler.

---

### Notes

1. React itself can’t enforce IP restrictions because it’s client-side. **You must block at nginx**.
2. You can mix this with your existing React catch-all:

```nginx
location / {
    root /var/www/multi/frontend/react-app/dist;
    index index.html;
    try_files $uri /index.html;
}
```

nginx will prefer the more specific `/admin-login` block before falling back to `/`.

---

This approach also works if you want to **protect multiple routes**, just create a `location` block for each one with `allow` / `deny`.

If you want, I can give you a **ready-to-paste snippet** showing **React public routes, admin route restricted to specific IPs, Node/Flask APIs**, all in one nginx config. It will save mistakes in matching routes.
