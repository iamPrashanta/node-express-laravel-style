You can check your Node/Express app’s errors and logs from **PM2** using a few handy commands. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### 🧩 1. Check live logs (real-time)

```bash
pm2 logs unpay-node
```

This shows both `stdout` (normal logs) and `stderr` (errors) live — like watching the console output when you run `node index.js`.

To view only errors:

```bash
pm2 logs unpay-node --err
```

To stop viewing, press **Ctrl + C**.

---

### 🗂 2. View saved logs (without live tail)

PM2 saves logs by default under:

```
~/.pm2/logs/
```

So you can manually open them:

```bash
cd ~/.pm2/logs
ls
cat unpay-node-error.log
cat unpay-node-out.log
```

Or to read them nicely:

```bash
tail -n 50 ~/.pm2/logs/unpay-node-error.log
```

---

### ⚙️ 3. Inspect process details

```bash
pm2 describe unpay-node
```

This shows:

* Path to the script
* Working directory
* Environment variables
* Log file paths
* Status, memory, etc.

---

### 🧠 Tip

If you’re debugging startup crashes, it helps to **restart with logs open**:

```bash
pm2 restart unpay-node && pm2 logs unpay-node
```

That way you see the error as soon as it happens.

Would you like me to show you how to **configure PM2 to write logs to a custom path**, for easier reading and backup (for example inside your project `/var/www/vhosts/admin.unpay.in/multi/backend/node-express/logs`)?
